### Kibana App: Kaae

**KaaE** extends *Kibana* with **Alerting** and **Reporting** functionality to monitor, notify and report on data series changes using standard queries, programmable validators and a variety of configurable actions - Think of it as a free an independent ["Watcher"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/watcher/current/introduction.html) and ["Reporting"](https://www.elastic.co/products/reporting) alternative.

**KaaE** is also designed to simplify the process of creating and managing alerts and reports in Kibana via its integrated  App and Spy integration, while retaining baseline *logic and configuration style compatibility* with the Elastic counterparts.

### Kibana Plugin: Kaae Spy
The Kaae integrated Kibana plug-in extends the default Spy functionality to shape new prototype Watchers based on Visualize queries, and providing them to Kaae for fine editing and deployment.

### Kibana Alerts Display
KaaE alerts can easily be displayed back in Kibana dashboards using [saved search](https://github.com/elasticfence/kaae/wiki/KAAE-Alerts-in-Dashboard) visualizations

### Kibana Report Snapshots
Boss wants to see charts and reports? KaaE can grab timed snapshots of Kibana dashboards _(or any other website)_ and deliver them via email using the [report](https://github.com/elasticfence/kaae/wiki/KAAE-Report-Example) action
